A Python keylogger is a program designed to silently record and store every keystroke made by a user on a computer. Typically implemented using libraries like `keyboard` or `pynput`, the keylogger captures keystrokes in real-time, logging them along with timestamps to a file. This covert operation allows the keylogger to run discreetly in the background without the user's knowledge. While keyloggers can serve legitimate purposes such as monitoring computer usage or tracking employee activity, it's crucial to emphasize their potential for misuse. Developers often include disclaimers highlighting that keyloggers should only be used for educational or authorized purposes, discouraging any unauthorized or malicious activities. Proper use and ethical considerations are paramount to ensure keyloggers are employed responsibly, respecting individual privacy and legal boundaries.
